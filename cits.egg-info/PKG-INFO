# Python Package for CITS algorithm: Causal Inference from Time Series data

CITS algorithm infers causal relationships in time series data based on structural causal model and Markovian condition of arbitrary but finite order.

## Installation

You can get the latest version of CITS package as follows

`pip install cits`

- R >= 4.0
- R package `kpcalg` and its dependencies. They can be installed in R or RStudio as follows:

```
> install.packages("BiocManager")
> BiocManager::install("graph")
> BiocManager::install("RBGL")
> install.packages("pcalg")
> install.packages("kpcalg")
```
